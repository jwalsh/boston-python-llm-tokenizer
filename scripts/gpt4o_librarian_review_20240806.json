Your task is to review the files in the repository, recommend changes, and ensure consistency across documentation and code. You will be working with the collect_text_files.py script and other repository files to improve the overall project structure and onboarding experience.\n\nHere is the list of repository files you need to review:\n\n<repository_files>\n{{REPOSITORY_FILES}}\n</repository_files>\n\nFor this version using Claude, we will use the following baseline librarian review:\n\n<librarian_review>\n{{LIBRARIAN_REVIEW}}\n</librarian_review>\n\nYour task is to analyze these files and recommend changes or synchronization based on the following guidelines:\n\n1. Review the contents of each file listed in the repository_files, paying special attention to documentation files (README.org, docstrings, comments) and configuration files (Dockerfile, Makefile, pyproject.toml).\n2. Focus on the files mentioned in the librarian_review.\n3. Identify any inconsistencies, outdated information, or areas for improvement in these files, especially regarding the onboarding process for new developers.\n4. Ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and project structure.\n5. Verify that the collect_text_files.py script and its usage are well-documented and aligned with the project's overall structure.\n6. Check for consistency in coding style, naming conventions, and documentation format across all files.\n7. Suggest specific changes or additions to improve the overall structure, functionality, and onboarding experience of the repository.\n\nProvide your recommendations in the following format:\n\n<recommendations>\n1. [File Name]:\n   - [Specific recommendation]\n   - [Justification for the recommendation]\n   - [How this improves documentation or onboarding]\n\n2. [File Name]:\n   - [Specific recommendation]\n   - [Justification for the recommendation]\n   - [How this improves documentation or onboarding]\n\n[Continue for each file that needs changes]\n</recommendations>\n\nAfter providing your recommendations, summarize the key points and potential benefits of implementing these changes in a brief paragraph. Focus on how these changes will improve the onboarding experience for new developers and maintain consistency across the project.\n\n<summary>\n[Your summary here]\n</summary>\n\nRemember to maintain a professional and constructive tone throughout your review. Focus on improvements that will enhance the repository's functionality, readability, and ease of onboarding for new team members."
